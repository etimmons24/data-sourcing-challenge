# data-sourcing-challenge

This task is to prepare data for a recommendation system to help people find 
movie reviews and related movies.  The data is sourced from The New York Times 
(https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview)
and The Movie Database APIs (https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/search-and-query-for-details).  The data extraction produces a csv file and can be
used with natural language processing methods.

### Output

    collected_data.csv.

    The following fields are included in the output.  See the API documentation 
    for field definitions:
